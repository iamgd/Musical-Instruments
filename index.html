  <h2> <strong> Introduction:</strong> </h2>
  <p> <em> <b> Musical Instruments! </b> </em> A useful list of musical instruments with pictures and examples. Would you like to talk about your favourite band in English but do not know how to refer to musical instruments? Perhaps you play a
    musical
    instrument and would love to be able to tell your English speaking friends about this. Or maybe you simple want to add some music vocabulary to your repertoire. Whatever your needs, being able to mention the English names of musical instruments
    will greatly improve your vocabulary and assist you in your day to day conversations.</p>
  <p> A <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"> musical instrument </a></b> is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument—it is
    through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument.
